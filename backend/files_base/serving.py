"""Guarded local-file serving for the Files base (V1.1.1).

The base browses arbitrary user folders, so an endpoint that streams their bytes
is the one genuinely security-sensitive surface in the base
(SUITE_MODULE_CONTRACT.md section 10). Two independent dangers are handled here:

1. **Path escape.** The endpoint never accepts an absolute path — only a
   registered ``source`` plus a relative path — and then re-checks, after
   resolving symlinks, that the target still lives inside that source and
   outside Keivotos's own data tree.
2. **Active content.** Serving an arbitrary ``.html``/``.svg`` inline, on the
   app's own origin, would let that file's scripts call the local API (which can
   move and delete files). Only an explicit allowlist of inert media renders
   inline; everything else is forced to a download with ``nosniff``.

Isolated: no import of Danbooru or ``core``. The range helpers used to be
duplicated here from the Danbooru media path; with both consumers now in
existence they were extracted to ``services/range_serving.py`` (2026-07-25) and
are re-exported below, so ``serving.parse_range_header`` still resolves. A
service import is not a module import — ``range_serving`` knows nothing about
either surface.
